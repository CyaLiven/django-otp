This is a django-otp plugin that delivers tokens via Amazon's `SNS
<http://aws.amazon.com/sns/>`_. The expectation is that it will be used to
implement SMS-based two-factor authentication, although it's not strictly
limited to that.

See `django-otp <http://packages.python.org/django-otp>`_ for more information
on the OTP framework.
